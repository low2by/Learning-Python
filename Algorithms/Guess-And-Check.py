# Process called exhaustive enumeration

# Applies to a problem where …
#  You are able to guess a value for solution
#  You are able to check if the solution is correct

# You can keep guessing until
#  Find solution or
#  Have guessed all values

# Given an int, call it x, want to see if there is another int which is its
# square root
# Start with a guess and check if it is the right answer
# To be systematic, start with guess = 0, then 1, then 2, etc
def squareRoot(x):

    guess = 0

    while guess <= x:
